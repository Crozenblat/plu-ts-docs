# control flow

as every programming language that wants to be turing complete there has to be some sort of way to 

- execute code conditionally
- repeat specific parts of the code

to satisfy those requirements `plu-ts` implements

- [the `if then else` construct](./if_then_else.md)
- [the `pmatch` construct](./pmatch.md)
- [recursive funcitons](./recursion.md)
